# Geometrical Scene Characterization for 6-DoF Camera Pose Estimation

## Overview
This Master's project focuses on identifying a camera's six degrees of freedom (6-DoF) pose in world coordinates using object detection techniques. It is crucial in robotics and computer vision applications, facilitating accurate object positioning within a global frame.

### Key Features
- **Camera Pose Estimation**: Determine the camera's position and orientation in a global frame.
- **3D Object Detection**: Utilize pre-trained models for detecting objects and estimating their orientation and spatial translation.
- **Extrinsic Parameter Identification**: Calculate camera extrinsic parameters based on object detection outcomes.
